# Issues

If you are using Chrome, when double clicking on `index.htm` there is the following error:

`XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:force.csv. Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes`

If you use Firefox instead of Chrome this error does not happen. Also: using a web server (such as Wamp), which is a bit more cumbersome for testing purposes.
